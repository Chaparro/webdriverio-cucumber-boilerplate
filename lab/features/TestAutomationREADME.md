# What is test automation?

Test automation is the practice of automatically reviewing and validating a software product, such as a web application, to make sure it meets predefined quality standards for code style, functionality (business logic), and user experience.

# Testing practices typically involve the following stages:

### Unit testing: validates individual units of code, such as a function, so it works as expected
### Integration testing: ensures several pieces of code can work together without unintended consequences
### End-to-end testing: validates that the application meets the user’s expectations
### Exploratory testing: takes an unstructured approach to reviewing numerous areas of an application from the user perspective, to uncover functional or visual issues

Today, nearly all unit tests are fully automated and unit testing automation is considered a best practice. Integration tests are also largely automated and, if not, are typically skipped in favor of more manual end-to-end testing. The current wave of test automation efforts is largely focused on automating the end-to-end layer of the testing pyramid, which reduces the need for integration tests.

# 10 Principles of Test Automation

### Define Clear Objectives: Establish what you aim to achieve with test automation, such as reducing manual testing time or increasing test coverage.
### Select the Right Test Cases: Automate tests that are repetitive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. Focus on high-risk areas.
### Use a Modular Approach: Design your test scripts in a modular way to make them reusable and maintainable2.
### Maintain Test Data Independently: Keep test data separate from test scripts to make it easier to manage and update.
### Implement Continuous Testing: Integrate automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous feedback and early detection of issues.
### Ensure Scalability: Choose tools and frameworks that can scale with your project’s growth and complexity.
### Version Control: Use version control systems to manage your test scripts and track changes.
### Monitor and Analyze Results: Regularly review test results to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
### Keep Tests Fast and Reliable: Ensure that automated tests run quickly and provide consistent results.
### Invest in Training: Ensure your team is well-trained in the tools and practices of test automation.
